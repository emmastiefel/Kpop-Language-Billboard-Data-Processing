[Chorus: PSY]
I got it from my daddy
Daddy

[Verse 1: PSY]
I feel nice, you look nice
Once I saw you, oh my God, I became lucky
Don't think twice, The game’s already over
You'll be my curry, I'll be your rice
My name is P-S-Y, In Korean, Park Jae-Sang (Aye)
I want to fall into your dim pupil and swim in there
Hold on tight, Oppa is running, Onni
I’m a life companion Of a beautiful young lady

[Pre-Chorus: PSY]
Hold up, wait a minute
From now on, just you and me, we’re players
We are running out of time tonight, turn up louder
Oh you beautiful and passionate lady
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?

[Chorus: CL & PSY]
Hey, where'd you get that body from?
Where'd you get that body from?
Where'd you get that body from?
I got it from my daddy
I got it from my daddy
I got it, got it (Hey, where'd you get that body from?)
I got it from my daddy
I got it from my daddy
I got it, got it (Hey, where'd you get that body from?)
I got it from my dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, daddy
I got it from my dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, daddy

[Verse 2: PSY]
I'm on fire, take you higher
You are a masterpiece and I am a generous buyer
Don’t be a liar, reveal everything
I be your honey, never expire
I only sleep during the day, when night comes I’m a real man
Once I saw you, I was stuck
I could tell just by looking at you When I’m excited, I am a child
Oppa doesn’t turn the light on I just go in

[Pre-Chorus: PSY]
Hold up, wait a minute
From now on, just you and me, we’re players
We are running out of time tonight, turn up louder
Oh you beautiful and passionate lady
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?

[Chorus: CL & PSY]
Hey, where'd you get that body from?
Where'd you get that body from?
Where'd you get that body from?
I got it from my daddy
I got it from my daddy
I got it, got it (Hey, where'd you get that body from?)
I got it from my daddy
I got it from my daddy
I got it, got it (Hey, where'd you get that body from?)
I got it from my dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, daddy
I got it from my dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, daddy

[Bridge: PSY]
My papa was as superman, hey
I inherited it this body, hey
A gentleman who refuses himself as a gentleman
The craziest guy in this zone is me, hey

[Chorus: PSY]
I got it from my dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, daddy
I got it from my dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, daddy
I got it from my dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, daddy
