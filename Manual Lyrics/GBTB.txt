Who's gonna pull the trigger
A shot aiming for destiny
No more barriers
Who's gonna pull the trigger
I'm gonna break it all down
You can't beat 'em up
Yeah, you can't beat 'em up
 
Are you ready now, whispering shadow
Get used to it, even when you first see it
More deeply touched by your heart
Throw out the light and breathe
 
We are trapped players
Prayer in search for the missing time
So we keep on running for
So we keep on running for
You tonight, tonight, tonight
 
I had a dream that I was choking
Shouting to the world
Those who look like you and me
Free this rhythm
So we keep on running for
So we keep on running for
 
Go beyond the barrier
Go beyond the barrier
 
Who's gonna pull the trigger
A shot aiming for destiny
No more barriers
Who's gonna pull the trigger
I'm gonna break it all down
You can't beat 'em up
Yeah, you can't beat 'em up
 
Go beyond the barrier
Go beyond the barrier
Go beyond the barrier
Burn up tonight
 
Light your sight, time to go
Like we fight aimer's gun
A gunfire signals the beginning
Yeah, I threw the embers far away
 
There is no line here
Everything was hypocrisy
Everything you took away
After you've swallowed it all again
I will protect you
I'm different, fly with me
Up to the brand new square
 
I felt so desperate
I want you to hear everything
We want to be together
More brighter lights
So we keep on running for
So we keep on running for, yeah
 
Go beyond the barrier
 
Who's gonna pull the trigger
A shot aiming for the gaps
No more barriers
Who's gonna pull the trigger
I'm gonna break it all down
You can't beat 'em up, yeah
I walked it all
 
The thunder that rings in your heart
The language to be shouted
Even if I try to cover my ears
I will hear you, fly away
Time has stopped
At that moment, you and I face each other
Let it ring all around the world
 
Go beyond the barrier
 
Who's gonna pull the trigger
A shot that digs deeper
No more barriers
Who's gonna pull the trigger
I'm gonna break it all down
You can't beat 'em up
Yeah, you can't beat 'em up
 
Go beyond the barrier
Go beyond the barrier
Go beyond the barrier
Shoot out tonight
 
Who's gonna pull the trigger
Even hotter
We can shoot it out
Yeah, we can shoot it out
