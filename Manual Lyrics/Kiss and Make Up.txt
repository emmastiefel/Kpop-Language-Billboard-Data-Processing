[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And I'm tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this love's important
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa & Rosé]
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

[Verse 2: Jennie & Jisoo]
I am still
Not able to leave you; what am I doing?
I know someday it will be all over
And you will leave, but
Our broken relationship…
Can’t we try to fix it again
Don’t say a word
There is no end

[Pre-Chorus: Lisa & Rosé]
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time

[Chorus: Rosé, Lisa & Jennie]
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

[Bridge: Dua Lipa, Jisoo & Rosé]
Whatever it is, I don’t need it; having you is enough
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out
Do it just like the thrill of the first time you met me
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out
Kiss, kiss and make up

[Chorus: Dua Lipa, Rosé, Lisa & Jennie]
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

[Outro: Dua Lipa & BLACKPINK]
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
