[Intro]
BTS

[Chorus: Jung Kook]
Savage love, did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel, but you're savage, love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that

[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
If I woke up without ya, I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever 'til I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of keepin' me comin' back-to-back
I just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex lover but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know she creepin', I feel it in the air

[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook]
Every night and every day (And every day)
I try to make you stay, but you're...

[Chorus: Jung Kook]
Savage love, did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel, but you're savage, love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that

[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook]
Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
Your savage lo-lo-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that

[Verse 2: SUGA]
Perhaps love is nothing but a list of fleeting emotions
It always comes with conditions, what do I love?
Maybe the word ‘forever’ is just a sandcastle 
that collapses helplessly even before a gentle wave

[Verse 3: j-hope]
Every night, every day, I'm swept away by the waves
Don't know what I'm thinking (Can't get you outta my head)
Whether I’m afraid of you or that time
I’ll love you like a fire right now

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay, but you're...

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Savage love, did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel, but you're savage, love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that

[Post-Chorus: Jason Derulo, Jung Kook]
Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love (Oh)
Your savage lo-lo-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that, your savage love

[Bridge: Jason Derulo & BTS]
(Ooh la-la-la-la, ooh la-la-la-la)
Your savage lo-lo-love
(Ooh la-la-la-la, ooh la-la-la-la, ooh)
Your savage lo-lo-love
(Ooh la-la-la-la)
You could use me
(Ooh la-la-la-la)
Baby

[Chorus: Jung Kook]
Savage love (Oh, girl)
Did somebody, did somebody break your heart? (Break your heart)
Lookin' like an angel, but you're savage, love (Savage love, hey)
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that

[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook, Jason Derulo]
Your savage love (Savage love)
Your savage lo-lo-love (Your savage lo-lo-love)
Your savage lo-lo-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that, your savage love
